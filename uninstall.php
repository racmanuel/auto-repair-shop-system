 * - Check if the $_REQUEST['action'] content actually is delete-plugin
 * - Run a check_ajax_referer check to make sure it goes through authentication
 * - Run a current_user_can check to make sure current user can delete a plugin
 *
 * @todo Consider multisite. Once for a single site in the network, once sitewide.
